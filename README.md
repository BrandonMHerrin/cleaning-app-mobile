# Overview

I love learning new technologies. In the project I'm building an application to help 
manage cleaning businesses.

At this point Authentication is the only functionality that has been implmented. It is currently setup to use email authentication, but it does provide account creation, signin, and signout functionality.

I run a cleaning business and have often wished for an app that I could used to log service details and other items.

# Development Environment

I used expo and react native to create an application that would work on both iOS and Android. I chose to use supabase for the authentication layer as I felt that would work well as a database and help implmenting authentication as well.

I wrote everything in typescript and even leveraged a library called native wind that allowed using tailwind in a react native application.

# Future Work

* Users need to be able to keep track of vehicle mileage.
* Users need to be able to clock into a job and signoff on tasks completed.
* Users need to be able notify management of inventory that is running low.
